# D2k-Campaign-Resources
Place to put intermediate files to increase productivity on the D2k mod of OpenRA. (.oramap, savegames, screenshots)

The campaign maps have (currently) some graphical errors connected to incorrect tilesets. The new tileset fixes this. Download Missions and place arrakis_FIX.yaml (rename to arrakis.yaml) into OpenRA/mods/d2k/tilesets.

The map.yaml has been standardized (all factions) and modified to so editing in map editor and starting the maps in the singleplayer menu is possible without crash.
There is no map scriptiong however, so the missions do not work as originally intendet! You must write this script yourself.

Also, I have all savegames (GameSave) of the classic Dune2k game in a zip file here. Delete your own save files or rename them so the names show ascending order with no duplicates.
